CPS630 Iteration 2-3
This is an Art Gallery Website that uses PHP instead of HTML. HTML was used in Iteration 1.
The code is also stored into an sql database on the Ryerson servers. I also added an xml file as a backup of the database 
and an xslt stylesheet to show the tables when the xml is ran in a browser.
